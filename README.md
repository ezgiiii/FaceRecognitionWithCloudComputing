# GraduationThesis
Face Recognition With Cloud Computing

This project aims to recognize a face with an Android App. The main difference is that the prediction is made in Google Colab and sent to Android App by opening an ngrok tunnel and uitilizing a simple Flask API structure.

I am proud to sat that this project is done by me Ezgi Eftekin and my old friend Onur SaldamlÄ± and is our graduation thesis.

The Google Colab code is available in here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1s3ABv0CdLFIEarfFjZXUElrNbAxyjPLV?usp=sharing
I will only share the Android App code in git hub.
